# Awesome open-source VCs ðŸ’¸
Awesome list of VCs investing in commercial open-source startups.

## Criteria
VCs are added to the list if: 
1. They invested in at least 3 startups where the product is strongly based on an open-source repo
2. They are still investing actively

This list is work in progress, so please don't hesitate to [contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and add VCs. Let's build the most comprehensive list together.
